        <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <h4>Passion</h4>
        <p>
 After graduating college, I became a garment MR and worked with people from all around the world. I found fashion really interesting and I enjoyed it. I also found that I really enjoyed creating something like making my own website.

<h4>My Goal as a team player</h4>
<p>
	I am willing and able to do whatever task is necessary to complete the project. I would do my part in collecting necessary work and presenting it to the team. I would also be willing to lend a helping hand to other team members when needed. I would be glad to engage in discussions about issues with the project to help come to an effective resolution.
